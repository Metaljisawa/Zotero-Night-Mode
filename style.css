/* The body element is the root element of the page, so we can use it to apply styles to the entire page */
body {
  /* Set the background color to black */
  background-color: black;

  /* Set the text color to white */
  color: white;
}

/* The .night-mode class can be used to apply styles specifically for the night mode */
.night-mode {
  /* Set the background color to dark gray */
  background-color: #333;
}

/* This CSS file defines two sets of styles: one for the body element, which applies to the entire page, and one for elements with the night-mode class, which can be applied to specific elements to give them a different appearance in night mode.

In the body styles, the background-color is set to black and the color is set to white, which will make the background of the page black and the text white.

In the .night-mode styles, the background-color is set to a dark gray color, which could be used for elements that need a different background color in night mode.

Of course, this is just one possible approach to creating a night mode for a Zotero extension. You may want to adjust these styles or add additional styles to suit your specific needs.*/
